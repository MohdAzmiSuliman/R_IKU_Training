-   Workflow thinking
    1.  Treat individual R process and the associated workspace is disposable
    2.  Use IDE & Project Management
    3.  **Specified your default working directory**
    4.  Save your work in a script (or Quarto)
    5.  Always start with blank state
        -   When quit R, **DO NOT SAVE WORKSPACE**
        -   When start R, **DO NOT RESTORE WORKSPACE**
    6.  *Use version control* (advance)

       Examples = c("1, 2, 3", "a, b, c", TRUE, 1+0i, charToRaw("a"), "list(1,2,3)", "maen(age)", "")) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic()
