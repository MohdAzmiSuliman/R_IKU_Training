# R

## Introduction to R

-   R programming language is a lot like magic...
-   Except instead of spells, you have function

. . .

-   SPSS and SAS users are like muggles
    -   they are limited in their ability to change their environment
    -   they have to rely on algorithms developed for them
    -   the way they approach a programmed constrain by how SPSS/SAS programmers thought to approach them
    -   they have to pay to use these constraining algorithms
    
    

## Introduction to R

-   R programming language is a lot like magic...
-   Except instead of spells, you have function

. . .

-   R users are like wizard
    -   they can rely on spelss (functions) that have been devoloped for them
    -   they can also create their own
    -   they dont have to pay for the use of them
    -   and once experienced enough, they are almost unlimed in hier abilty to change their environment
    

## Open Source?

-   **Free!** You dont have to pay to use R.
-   You can use it on **any computer**.
-   You have full access to algorithm and their implementation.
-   You can modify the code to suit your needs.
-   Promote **REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH** by providing open and accessible tools
-   It is **CUTTING EDGE**

## What is R?

-   R is a programming language
-   R is high level language
    -   Code that easy to read and write, close to human language
-   R is a interpreted computer language
    -   Execute line by line
    -   No need to compile
    -   The software that interpret R language and execute to codes
-   Provide a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis


## What is R?

-   R is used for data manipulation, statistics and graphic. Made of
    -   operators
    -   functions
    -   objects
    -   packages

## Pros and Cons

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="48%"}
**Pros**

-   Fast and Free
-   State of the art
-   Active user community
-   **Forces you to *think* about your analysis** 
-   **New tehcniques available without delayed**

:::

:::{.column width="4%"}
:::

:::{.column width="48%"}
**Cons**

-   Steep learning curve
-   Some commercial support
-   In the beginning, data prep & cleaning can be messier and more mistake prone
-   Easy to make mistakes and not know
-   *Limited in handling very large dataset*
-   *Can be difficult to choos the best pacakge for you need*

## SPSS and R

-   Learning (and using) R require new paradigm of thinking
    -   R is programming language and 99% of the time, you will be writing code
        -   this is not an exam. you don't have to remember everything. 
        -   google (and *ai chatbox*) is your friend


## SPSS and R

-   Learning (and using) R require new paradigm of thinking
    -   Almost everything in R is an objects
        -   You can create, modify, and delete
        -   Import external files
        -   Many different dataset available at same time
        -   Dataset can be any dimension
    -   SPSS only available one dataset at a time
        -   SPSS datasets are rectangular


    
## Learning R

-   CRAN website, manuals
-   Because R is interactive, errors are your friends!
-   `?lm` fives you help on lm function.
-   reading help files can be very helpful
-   **MOST IMPORTANT** - the more time you spend using R, the more comfortable you become with it


# RStudio

## What is RStudio?

-   RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R
-   It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

## RStudio for Statistical Analysis Workflow

-   RStudio is designed to support the entire data analysis workflow
-   Managing - Creating & Running R scripts
-   Managing projects for better organization
-   Support version control (Git).

## R consoles

-   This is the R consoles
    -   This is where you can type in R command/code
