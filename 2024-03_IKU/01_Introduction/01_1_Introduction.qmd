# R

## Introduction to R

-   R programming language is a lot like magic...
-   Except instead of spells, you have a function.

. . .

-   SPSS and SAS users are like muggles
    -   They are limited in their ability to change their environment.
    -   They have to rely on algorithms developed for them.
    -   The way they approach a programmed constrain by how SPSS/SAS programmers thought to come them
    -   they have to pay to use these constraining algorithms

## Introduction to R

-   R programming language is a lot like magic...
-   Except instead of spells, you have a function

. . .

-   R users are like wizards.
    -   They can rely on spells (functions) that have been developed for .them
    -   They can also create their own
    -   They do not have to pay for the use of them.
    -   And once experienced enough, they are almost unlimed in their ability to change their environment.

## Open Source?

-   **Free!** You don't have to pay to use R.
-   You can use it on **any computer**.
-   You have full access to algorithm and their implementation.
-   You can modify the code to suit your needs.
-   Promote **REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH** by providing open and accessible tools.
-   It is **CUTTING EDGE**

## What is R?

-   R is a programming language.
-   R is a high-level language.
    -   Code that is easy to read and write, close to human language
-   R is an interpreted computer language.
    -   Execute line-by-line
    -   No need to compile
    -   The software that interprets R language and executes codes
-   Provide an extensive, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.

## Is it relevance to me?

-   IKU is one of **RESEARCH INSTITUTE** in Malaysia
    -   That mean our main job is doing research (and related activities)
-   We depend on data to make decisions
    -   80% of our time is spent on data **preparation and cleaning**
-   We also require effective data visualization to communicate our findings

## Pros and Cons

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Pros**

-   Fast and Free
-   State of the art
-   Active user community
-   **It forces you to *think* about your analysis.**
-   **New techniques available without delayed**

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Cons**

-   Steep learning curve
-   Some commercial support
-   In the beginning, data prep & cleaning can be messier and more mistake-prone
-   It is easy to make mistakes and not know.
-   *Limited in handling huge dataset*
-   *It can be not easy to choose the best package for you need*

## SPSS and R

-   Learning (and using) R require a new paradigm of thinking.
    -   R is a programming language, and you will be writing code 99% of the time.
        -   This is not an exam. You don't have to remember everything.
        -   Google (and *AI chatbox*) is your friend

## SPSS and R

-   Learning (and using) R requires a new paradigm of thinking.
    -   Almost everything in R is an objec.ts
        -   You can create, modify, and delete
        -   Import external files
        -   Many different options are available at the same time.
        -   The dataset can be any dimension.
    -   SPSS only available one dataset at a time
        -   SPSS datasets are rectangular

## Learning R

-   CRAN website, manuals
-   Because R is interactive, errors are your friends!
-   `?lm` gives you help on the lm function.
-   Reading help files can be very helpful.
-   **MOST IMPORTANT** - the more time you spend using R, the more comfortable you become with it

# RStudio

## What is RStudio?

-   RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
-   It includes a console and syntax highlighting editor that supports direct code execution and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management.

## RStudio for Statistical Analysis Workflow

-   RStudio is designed to support the entire data analysis workflow.
-   Managing - Creating & Running R scripts
-   Managing projects for better organisation
-   Support version control (Git).

## R consoles

-   This is the R consoles.
    -   This is where you can type in the R command/code.

## RStudio GUI

-   This is the RStudio
    -   The IDE for R

# Why learn R and RStudio?

# Quarto

## What is Quarto?

# Expectation?

## R Language as a programming language

These are some of the things that I have learned and used in R:

-   Basic/Intermediate data wrangling with tidyverse
-   Basic/Intermediate statistical analysis with R
-   Basic data visualisation with ggplot2
-   Code notebook with Quarto
-   Basic reporting with Quarto (HTML, PDF, Word)

:::{.notes}
R is not just about statistics and data analysis. As a programming language, R can do various things

## R Language as a programming language

But I am not an expert in R. I am still learning and looking for study group to help improve my R.

-   Machine learning with R
-   Making a dashboard with Shiny
-   Making a website with Quarto
-   Making custom functions and packages
-   R as teaching tools
