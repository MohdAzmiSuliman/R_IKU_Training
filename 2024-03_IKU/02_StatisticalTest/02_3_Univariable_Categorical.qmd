# Univariate Analysis of Categorical Data

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, gtsummary)
asthmads_clean <- read_sav("asthmads_clean.sav") %>% 
  as_factor()
```

-   Pearson's Chi-Square Test
-   Fisher's Exact Test
-   McNemar's Test

# Contingency Table

## Contingency Table

-   Bivariate analysis involves examining the relationship between two variables
-   When both variables are categorical, bivariate analysis looks at how these categories are related
-   Bivariate analyses of categorical data often involve the use of contingency tables.
    -   Simple matrix that displays the frequency distribution of the variables.
-   Other names include:
    -   Cross-tabulation
    -   2x2 Table

## Contingency Table Example

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Contingency Table Structure"

library(tibble)
library(kableExtra)

tribble(
  ~Status,        ~"Lung Cancer", ~"No Lung Cancer", ~"Total",
  "Smoker",       "a",      "b",         "a+b",
  "Non-Smoker",   "c",      "d",         "c+d",
  "Total",        "a+c",    "b+d",       "N"
) %>% 
  kbl(align = "lccr") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

-   Row: Independent Variable
-   Column: Dependent Variable
-   The letters a, b, c, and d represent the cell frequencies:
-   Total: the sum of the frequencies in the respective row or column, with N being the grand total of all observations.

::: notes
-   the independent variable (or the predictor, i.e. the smoking status) is the row
-   the dependent variable (or the outcome, i.e. the cancer status) is the column
-   The letters a, b, c, and d represent the cell frequencies:
    -   a: The number of smokers who have the disease.
    -   b: The number of smokers who do not have the disease.
    -   c: The number of non-smokers who have the disease.
    -   d: The number of non-smokers who do not have the disease.
-   "Total" is the sum of the respective row or column frequencies, with N being the grand total of all observations.

Concordance vs Discordance

## Practical: Contingency Table (Base R)

-   Let's try to create a contingency table: Gender vs Work Status
-   First, identify the variables
    -   Either look at the dataset

```{r}
asthmads_clean
```

## Practical: Contingency Table (Base R)

-   Let's try to create a contingency table: Gender vs Work Status
-   First, identify the variables
    -   Or find the variable names using the `names` function

```{r}
names(asthmads_clean)
```

## Practical: Contingency Table (Base R)

-   Let's try to create a contingency table: Gender vs Work Status
    -   Gender: Gender
    -   Work Status: WorkStatus

```{r}
with(asthmads_clean, table(Gender, WorkStatus))
```

## Practical: Contingency Table (`gtsummary`)

-   Let's try to create a contingency table: Gender vs Work Status

```{r}
asthmads_clean %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = WorkStatus, 
              include = Gender) %>% 
  add_overall(last = T)
```

# Pearson's Chi-Square Test

## Pearson's Chi-Square Test

-   to determine the association between two categorical variables.
-   these are the assumptions:
    -   The variables are **categorical**.
    -   The grouping is **mutually exclusive**
    -   The observations are **independent**.
    -   The expected frequency count for **at least 80% of the cells is at least 5**.
    -   The expected frequency count for **each cell is at least 1**.

## Practical: Pearson's Chi-Square Test

-   Let's try to perform Pearson's Chi-Square Test
-   E.g., association between gender and work status among the sample.

```{r}
with(asthmads_clean, table(Gender, WorkStatus)) %>% 
  chisq.test()
```

-   By default, the `chisq.test` function will apply the Yates' continuity correction.

## Practical: Pearson's Chi-Square Test

-   Let's try to perform Pearson's Chi-Square Test
-   E.g., association between gender and work status among the sample.
-   We need to specify the `correct` parameter to `FALSE` to avoid Yates' continuity correction.

```{r}
with(asthmads_clean, table(Gender, WorkStatus)) %>% 
  chisq.test(correct = F)
```

## Small samples

-   Pearson's Chi-Square Test is only reliable with medium to large datasets.
-   Assumptions for Pearson's Chi-Square Test will be violated if the dataset is small.
-   The alternatives for small samples
    -   Yates' Continuity Correction
    -   Fisher's Exact Test

## Fisher's Exact Test

-   The code for Fisher's Exact Test is similar to Pearson's Chi-Square Test.

```{r}
with(asthmads_clean, table(Gender, WorkStatus)) %>% 
  fisher.test()
```

## Pearsone's Chi-Square Test with `gtsummary`

-   We can perform the test with the `add_p` function from the `gtsummary` package.

```{r}
asthmads_clean %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = WorkStatus, 
              include = Gender) %>% 
  add_p()
```

## Pearson's Chi-Square Test with `gtsummary`

-   We can perform the test with the `add_p` function from the `gtsummary` package.
-   Note: **refer to the help page to understand the default settings for the test**

```{r}
#| eval: false

?add_p
```

## McNemar Test

-   Used for paired data

```{r}
with(asthmads_clean, table(SxWheeze_Pre, SxWheeze_Post))

with(asthmads_clean, table(SxWheeze_Pre, SxWheeze_Post)) %>% 
  mcnemar.test()
```
