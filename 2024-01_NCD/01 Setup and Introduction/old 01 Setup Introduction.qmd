## Before we start

- Different people may use R and RStudio differently
- Having a sensible workflow can improve you work

## Workflow thinking

- treat individual R process and the associated workspace is disposable
- dont treat your workspace as a pet, i.e. it hold precious objects and you arent 100% sure you can reproduce them.
- if you have this attachment, that inidcate you have a non-reproducible workflow.

## Prerequisite for workflow thinking

- Use IDE. 
  - Use ID with proper support for project
- Always start R with blank state. 
  - when quit R, do not save workspace to an .Rdata file. 
  - when launch R, do not reload the workspace from .Rdata file. 
- Restart R often during development. 
  - avoid rm(list = ls())
  - develop cripts in fresh R process
